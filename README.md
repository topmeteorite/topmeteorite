- 👋 Hi, I’m Dustin @topmeteorite a returning dev getting into python, R, and big data sets to support my late career research.
- 👀 I’m interested in supporting my own and others' research in meteoritics, geochemistry, petrology, mineralogy, and space sciences with simple easy to use tools to help automate many of the repetative and difficult tasks using python, R, and SQL usually leaning heavily on matploblib and numpy, and using spyder dev environement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everyday!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meteorite and space science related projects.
